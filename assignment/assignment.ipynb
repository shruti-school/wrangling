    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "    the paper talks about finding the best and easiest ways to clean data, called data tidying. He talks about how data cleaning is often overlooked and it can be a really hard and tedious task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "    The tidy data standard is way to standardized cleaning data by having some rules/guidelines to follow. This is to make data cleaning easier to follow and more approachable for people to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "    The first sentence means that if a dataset is tidy then there is a standard to follow and it would make it easier to analyze the data. Messy datasets however are all different and have no standard to them at all so are hard to work with. The second sentence talks about how it can be easy to just see the structure of the dataset but hard to see what the dataset actually means and how to generalize that to an audience which also has an effect on how the data is cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "     He defined values to be numbers or strings. He called variables a collection of values that describe one thing or concept. And he says that observations are all of the values that pertain to one unit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "     Tidy Data is defined as a dataset where every variable is a column and every observation is its own row and one obersational unit is a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "     The following are the most common problems with messy datasets:\n",
    "     - Column headers contain data values (like specific years) instead of descriptive variable names\n",
    "     - Multiple variables are packed into a single column\n",
    "     - Time data often require conversion to a more standardized format\n",
    "     - Data variables are scattered across both rows and columns.\n",
    "     - Different types of observational units are combined within a single table\n",
    "     - The same observational unit is spread across multiple tables, which results in duplicated data and requires further cleaning to simplify.\n",
    "    Table 4 is considered messy because the columns correspond to values of an implicit variable, income. Income should instead have its own column with other variables. Melting\" a dataset refers to the process of reorganizing data so that the values stored in columns are shifted into rows, making the data structure more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "    Table 11 is messy because instead of a variable on the top it has values which are the says but table 12 is molten because it put all of the days together under a variable called date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
    "    The chicken and egg problem is that we associated the data cleaning tools too much with the actual data cleaning. He is hoping that in the future data cleaning becomes a more robust structure and school of thought rather than a thing just based on the tools used."

    "**Q3.** Many important datasets contain a race variable, typically limited to a handful of values often including Black, White, Asian, Latino, and Indigenous. This question looks at data gathering efforts on this variable by the U.S. Federal government.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did the most recent US Census gather data on race?\n",
    "The US Census gathered this data through surveying people and self reporting. People were asked to select their race from a dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do we gather these data? What role do these kinds of data play in politics and society? Why does data quality matter?\n",
    "This data is important because it can inform us about how different demographics view certain issues and what we can do to make sure that all demographics are included in political decisions. We father this data so that politicians are able to see what kind of policies they need to make to help everyone and for campaigning to different groups. The quality of this data matters so that everyone is represented in these political decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
    "I thought that the data was gathered well and I think that self identifying was a good way to do this. I think that any way of data sampling is going to end up with a lot of people msised because the reality is a lot of people don't want their data to be sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How did the Census gather data on sex and gender? Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices.\n",
    "The 2020 U.S. Census gathered data on sex by asking respondents to identify as either \"male\" or \"female.\" There was no explicit option for non-binary or other gender identities. While the Census allowed respondents to self-identify their race and ethnicity with more flexibility, the approach to gender was more binary. I think that there could be an option to include more genders or let people self identify instead of just male and female because it leaves out a whole dmeographic of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to cleaning data on protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race, several significant concerns emerge. One major issue is the potential for erasure and bias based on how you clean the data. If missing values are filled in based on assumptions or dominant group values, this would erase so many people and their identities from the data. Additionally, simplifying complex identities into broad categories means that you are also simplifying the data too much and losing its integrity. Good practices involve transparency in how missing data is handled, engaging community input, and using diverse datasets for more accurate imputation. Bad practices can include ignoring missing values or using overly simplistic methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?\n",
    "If someone were to develop an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality, several serious concerns would arise. One of the primary ethical implications is the risk of reinforcing existing biases. Algorithms trained on biased data can perpetuate stereotypes and misrepresent marginalized groups, ultimately leading to harmful outcomes. Additionally, such imputation practices can undermine individual agency by erasing unique identities and experiences. Even AI models like ChatGPT has a lot of bias based on how it was trained so this could be very harmful if it is not monitored properly."
